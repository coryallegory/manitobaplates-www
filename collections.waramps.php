		The War Amps of Canada, dedicated originally for disabled Canadian war veterans, instituted a program with small replica license plates as a source of income for the organization. If keys were lost with the tag on, postage to the registered owner was guaranteed. Beginning in 1946 the tag matched the owner's license plate until 1971. From 1971 until 1996 the traditional aluminum frame continued. Since 1997 the plastic tag has been issued. 1955 is considered the hardest to collect, no one knows why.
