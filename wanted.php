			I am always looking to purchase <b>any</b> Manitoba license plates and related automobilia, and I'm always interested in upgrading my collection as well.

			I'm also interested in buying old motorcycles and parts.

				I will buy one plate or an entire collection to get what I need, <b>and I am always looking to purchase back my grandfather's #52 Manitoba license plates from 1911-1926. They were stolen from our family home while my father was fighting during WW2.</b>

				I don't care how, or who you acquired them from. Too much water has passed under the bridge in seventy-five years. My family and I would just like to complete the run of #52 plates from 1911 to 1926 as they were originally issued to my grandfather.
				<p />
				Please Note: we are in possession of the original 1911 disc, and fellow collector Ed Marchuck was kind enough to trade back to us #52's from 1918 and 1919. That still leaves a number of #52's out there somewhere. I would appreciate your help.
